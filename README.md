Batch Normalization
===================

This is my experiment in batch normalization using numpy (no Tensorflow or other high-level libraries).

This is all based on the paper 'Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift' by Ioffe and Szegedy (2015).
